## Contributing

This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

We use the GitHub issue tracker to discuss new features and non-trivial bugs. In addition to the issue tracker, the [#appid-at-ibm Slack channel](https://ibm-cloud-success.slack.com/) is an easy way to get in touch with the maintainers.

To contribute code, documentation, or tests, please submit a pull request to the GitHub repository. Generally, we expect two maintainers to review your pull request before it is approved for merging. For more details, see the MAINTAINERS page.
