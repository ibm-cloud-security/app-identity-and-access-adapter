  ## This is the source of the adapter docker image
  repository: aliberat1/istio-adapter-ibmcloudappid
  ## The image version to pull. Tag "latest" always contains

## These keys are primarily used for cookie encryption
## Symmetric signing and encryption keys are created on 
## initialization. 
keys:
  ## The hashKey is required, used to authenticate 
  ## the cookie value using HMAC. It is recommended 
  ## to use a key with 32 or 64 bytes.
  hashKeySize: 32
  ## The blockKey is used to encrypt the cookie value. 
  ## The length must correspond to the block size of the AES encryption algorithm. 
  ## Valid lengths are 16, 24, or 32 bytes to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.
  blockKeySize: 16

## Logging is facilitated by the zapcore uber library https://godoc.org/go.uber.org/zap/zapcore
logging:
  
  ## By default logging is output in a json format
  ## which can be easily consumed by the 3rd party 
  ## logging systems. Setting this value to false 
  ## produces a more easily readable string format
  json: true

  ## The log output level defaults to 0 [INFO]. For more
  ## voluminous logging, use DEBUG (-1). Logging can be configured
  ## from -1 to 7
